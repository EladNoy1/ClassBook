Open the command line terminal in 'ClassBook/Project/'

1. Type 'python manage.py migrate --fake classbook_core zero 
[This will fake all the migrations. more info here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46772762/django-migrate-fake-and-fake-initial-explained]

2. Delete the db.sqlite3 file
[delete the DB file]

3. Type 'python manage.py migrate'


** If you need to make changes to the initial auto generated migration file (0001_initial) - the process is a little bit more complex.
Adding methods to models.py is not an issue, however if you add new models (classes) - this will cause issues with the 0001 initial migration file.

In such a case - after deleting the DB file:

    1. Backup the manually created migration files
    2. Delete the 0001_initial.py file (auto generated file after running makemigrations)
    3. Type 'python manage.py makemigrations'
        [this will make a new initial migration file - containing all the new classes you added to models.py]
    4. Restore the manual migration files from step 1
    5. Type 'python manage.py migrate'
